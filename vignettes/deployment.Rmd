```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
old.hooks = fansi::set_knit_hooks(knitr::knit_hooks)
options(crayon.enabled = TRUE)
```

`tic` handles the deployment as follows:

1. When calling `travis::use_travis_deploy()` (either directly or indirectly by using `usethis::use_ci()`), a public key is added to GitHub repository under the "Deploy keys" section and the user receives an e-mail

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi = 10}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ssh-deploy-key.png")
```

2. A private key is encoded in base64 and stored in an environment variable on Travis, and installed in the ~/.ssh directory during the CI run

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi = 10}
knitr::include_graphics("img/private-key-travis.png")
```

Initiating the deployment via a public-private key pair has the advantage that rights are granted to a single repo only and the setup process can be automated.
Additionally,when calling `use_ci()` a Personal Access token (PAT) is created (by `travis::create_github_pat()`) to avoid the errors caused by Githubs download rate limitations. 

## pkgdown deployment

Today, it becomes more and more standard to have a `pkgdown` site for a R package which presents all the well-written vignettes and function documentations in a nicely styled web version.
But this is only valuable if the information also reflects the most recent state of the repo.
Do not waste time on updating your site manually - automate such tasks!

As an example, we show you how `tic` initiates the deployment on Travis.
In the `.travis.yml` file: 

```yml
before_deploy: R -q -e 'tic::before_deploy()'
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: R -q -e 'tic::deploy()'
  on:
    all_branches: true
```

Let's break down what happens here:

1. Travis executes `tic::before_deploy()` which will search for instructions regarding the `before_deploy()` stage in `tic.R`. 

    By default this looks like

    ```r
    if (Sys.getenv("BUILD_PKGDOWN") != "") {
      get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
        add_step(step_setup_ssh())
    }
    ```

    This block finally executes the function `step_setup_ ssh()` if the environment variable `"BUILD_PKGDOWN"` is set in the Travis build.
    That is just one condition among many that you can set to run certain commands (or stages) conditionally (see [here](advanced.html#running-stages-conditionally) for more examples).
    After the prerequisite of setting up an ssh key for the upcoming deployment has been finished, 

2. Travis is told to use a "script" (provider: script) for the deployment (which holds further instructions).

3. This "script" is then calling `tic::deploy()`.

4. All this is only happening on the `master` branch, meaning that other branches do not trigger a deploy with this condition set.

    What happens now is that `tic::deploy()` again searches in `tic.R` for the "deploy" stage and then runs whatever you have specified there.

    With the default template of `tic.R`, the following will be executed:

    ```r
    get_stage("deploy") %>%
      add_step(step_build_pkgdown()) %>% 
      add_step(step_push_deploy())
    ```

    First, `step_build_pkgdown()` will build your `pkgdown` site and afterwards (note the `pipe` operator), `step_push_deploy()` takes care to push the results to your repo.
    By default this will be the `docs/` directory of the `master` branch.


## pkgdown deployment

You may optionally set the deployment branch to `gh-pages` and then change the branch serving your site in the Github repo settings (change it to `gh-pages`).
`pkgdown` sites of an R package can either be served from the `/docs` directory of the `master` branch of from the root of the `gh-pages` branch.
Using the latter option has the advantage to not have all the automatic commits from Travis in the `master` branch -> the `pkgdown` site will be "silently" updated in the background.
Simply set the `branch` argument in `step_push_deploy()` to `gh-pages`.

Also, make sure to set `orphan = TRUE`.
This causes the branch to only consist of the commit that was pushed to Github (which is what you want for the `gh-pages` branch).
Don't worry, this option won't work when pushing to the current branch, so no worries about accidentally deleting your whole repo ;-)
Now, `step_push_deploy(path = "docs", branch = "gh-pages", orphan = TRUE)` will deploy the files generated by `step_build_pkgdown()` to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo.

If you are running a build matrix or build stages on Travis, you only want to run the `pkgdown` building and deployment once.
However, sometimes you want to deploy multiple files in different stages.
You can restrict on which stage/job a task is executed with the help of environment variables.
There are two ways to restrict the deployment with `tic` and environment variables: 

1. Setting the condition in `tic.R`
2. Setting the condition directly in `.travis.yml` in the "deploy" section

Sometimes, env variables are implicitly set, e.g. when testing on multiple R versions (see example 2) (or by Travis itself, see [Travis CI Meta-Information](advanced.html#travis-ci-meta-information)).
There is no practical difference between both approaches.
However, conditioning like shown here does only work for the "deploy" stage in `.travis.yml`.
For [conditioning other stages](advanced.html#running-stages-conditionally), you need to use the `tic` approach.

In the following we prepared an example for each option:

1. Specifically set the env variable `BUILD_PKGDOWN` in `.travis.yml` and add the condition in `tic.R` to only run the deploy stage when this env variable evaluates to TRUE:

```yml
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: stage1
      env: BUILD_PKGDOWN=TRUE
      before_install: R -q -e 'install.packages("remotes"); remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/tic"); tic::prepare_all_stages(); tic::before_install()'
      [...]
      deploy:
        provider: script
        script: R -q -e 'tic::deploy()'
        on:
          all_branches: true
    - stage: stage2
      before_install: R -q -e 'install.packages("remotes"); remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/tic"); tic::prepare_all_stages(); tic::before_install()'
      [...]
      deploy:
        provider: script
        script: R -q -e 'tic::deploy()'
        on:
          all_branches: true
```

`tic.R`:

```r
if (Sys.getenv("id_rsa") != "") {
  get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_setup_ssh())
}

if (Sys.getenv("BUILD_PKGDOWN") != "") {
  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_build_pkgdown()) %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
}
```

2. Setting the condition directly in `.travis.yml` in the "deploy" section:

This can be useful when you run a build matrix which tests multiple R versions that has the same workflow for every job:

```
r:
  - release
  - devel
  - oldrel
```

Here we restrict the deployment on three conditions: 

- No Pull Request
- No CRON job ([CRON jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/) are builds that are started automatically after no build was triggered after a specific time)
- Only for builds that use the R "devel" version

```yml
deploy:
   provider: script
   script: R -q -e 'tic::deploy()'
   on:
     branch: master
     condition:
       - $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = false
       - $TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE != cron
       - $TRAVIS_R_VERSION_STRING = devel
```

The same could optionally also be specified in `tic.R`. 
There is no difference between the two approaches:

```r
if (Sys.getenv("BUILD_PKGDOWN") != "" && 
  Sys.getenv("TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE") != "cron" && 
    Sys.getenv("TRAVIS_R_VERSION_STRING") == "devel") {
  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_build_pkgdown()) %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
}
```

## Committing single files

Function `step_push_deploy()` has the ability to only commit and push single files if they have changed during a CI build.
This can be very useful for conditionally pushing documentation files like `NEWS` or `man/` and `NAMESPACE` if these are automatically created via Travis.
First, you need to make sure these files are created correctly by calling `devtools::document()`.
Then, simply add the desired paths to argument `commit_paths` in `step_push_deploy()` and push to your desired branch (here `master`):

```r
get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_setup_ssh())

  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_code_step(devtools::document(roclets=c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))) %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy(orphan = FALSE, branch = "master", 
                              commit_paths = c("NAMESPACE", "man/*")))
```

Applying this idea of course depends on your overall R package development strategy: Commit files like `/man/` and `NS` directly or let them be created by Travis? 
An example project that uses the latter strategy is [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrng/blob/master/tic.R).
