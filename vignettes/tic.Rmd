# Prerequisites

If you are unfamiliar with the term Continuous Integration (CI), we highly recommend to read the following resources:

- https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/ci.html
- https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/
- http://mahugh.com/2016/09/02/travis-ci-for-test-automation/

The advantages of using `tic` for R-related CI workflows are: 

- CI-agnostic workflow definitions (in R!)
- Simplified deployment (e.g. automatic deployment of a `pkgdown` site for a R package)
- Improved package checking via [rcmdcheck](https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck)
- Robust caching approach

A more comprehensive summary of all advantages can be found in the [tic-advantages](tic-advantages.html) vignette.

# Initialization

The easiest way to use `tic` for CI services is to call `usethis::use_ci()`.
This will create templates for both "Travis CI" and "Appveyor" and initialize all the required authentication steps for deployment.
During the process, browser pages will open app ensuring that all permissions are set correctly and all apps are authorized.
Also a Personal Access Token (PAT) will be created for Travis, using a private Github PAT variable.
Read [here](https://itsalocke.com/blog/using-travis-make-sure-you-use-a-github-pat/) why this is important.
Note that this procedure cannot be fully automated currently.

[ADD CODE OUTPUT OF use_ci()]

The functionality is integrated in the [`usethis`](http://usethis.r-lib.org/) package because it contains various other useful `use_*` functions that simplify R (package) development.
However, the heavy lifting in the background is actually done by the R packages `travis` and `tic`. 
See [here](tic-usethis-travis.html) for more detailed information on how `tic`, `travis` and `usethis` work together.

# Setup

## R packages

After having called `usethis::use_ci()` you will find `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml` and a `tic.R` file in your repo.
The default template will trigger builds on both CI services that do the following:

- Install required dependencies of the R package
- Run `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()` on the package (see [here](tic-advantages#rcmdcheck-r-cmd-check) for more details)
- Build a `pkgdown` site and deploy it to the `docs/` folder of the `master` branch (Travis only)
- Run a code coverage on the package and upload it to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) (Travis only)

The commands that are going to be executed in each stage of each service are specified in a centralized file `tic.R` - read [here](tic-advantages.html) for a more thorough explanation of all advantages of `tic`.

## Examples

`tic` can also be used for `bookdown`, `blogdown`, `rmarkdown`, `drat`, and `packagedocs`  projects. 
It can also publish to `figshare`.
See the example projects below for more information.

- [tic.blogdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.blogdown)
- [ŧic.bookdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.bookdown)
- [tic.drat](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.drat)
- [tic.R-package](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.package)
- [tic.rmarkdown](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.website)
- [tic.figshare](https://github.com/krlmlr/tic.figshare).

# What's not covered yet?

- `SystemRequirements`: `tic` is not yet capable of automatically determining system requirements specified in DESCRIPTION files of an R package. 
Our plan is to automatically provide suggestions like "Please add addons: apt: <library> to `.travis.yml`".

# Advanced

The advanced usage of `tic` is described in more detail in article [Advanced Usage](advanced.html):

- [Options for `pkgdown` deployment](advanced.html#pkgdown-deployment) 
- [Using Travis CI Meta-information](advanced.html#using-travis-ci-meta-information)
- [Troubleshooting: Running `tic` locally](advanced.html#troubleshooting-running-tic-locally)
- [Troubleshooting: Enter into the Travis build](advanced.html#troubleshooting-running-tic-locally)
- [Writing custom steps](custom-steps.html)

The build lifecycle when using `tic` is explained in detail [here](build-lifecycle.html).
